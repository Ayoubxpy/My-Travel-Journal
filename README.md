🌍 My Travel Journal
A React Project
<p align="center"> <strong>A data-driven React app that showcases travel destinations using reusable components.</strong> </p>
✨ Overview

My Travel Journal is a React project built to practice component reusability, props, and rendering UI from an array of data.
Each travel entry is generated dynamically from a single data source, keeping the code clean, scalable, and easy to maintain.

This version includes personal customizations with real Moroccan locations.
