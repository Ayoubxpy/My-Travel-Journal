📍 My Travel Journal (React)

My Travel Journal is a React project that displays memorable places using reusable components and data-driven rendering. Each location is rendered from a structured data array, allowing the UI to scale easily without repetitive code.

This version of the project includes custom personal changes beyond the original exercise.
